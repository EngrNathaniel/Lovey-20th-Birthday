                    <h3>Movie Date</h3>
                    <p>I love when we pick a movie and watch it at the same time. We are far away, but it feels like we are sitting next to each other.
I love hearing you during the movie. When you laugh at funny parts or get scared, it makes me so happy. Sometimes you say cute things about the movie, and it makes everything better. When we both laugh at the same time or both say "wow" together, it makes me smile so much. It feels like a real date even though we are not together. After the movie, we talk about what we liked. These talks are so fun and make me feel close to you. These movie nights are special to me. They show we can still have dates and make good times together even when we are far away.
I can't wait for our next movie night!</p>

                    <h3>Laughing Together</h3>
                    <p>One of my best times with you baby is when we laugh together, the sound that makes everything better. 
I love when we talk and then one of us says something funny or when we see funny things online, and we both start laughing so much. Your laugh is so pretty, and it makes me laugh even more. Sometimes we laugh so hard that we can't talk. We just keep laughing and trying to breathe. When this happens, I forget we are far away because it feels like you are here with me. Even when we have bad days, we still find things to laugh about. You always make me feel better with your smile and laugh. These happy times show me why I love you so much. We can't be together right now, but we still make each other happy every day.
I love that we can still have fun together even when we are far apart. Your laugh makes me feel so good.</p>

                    <h3>Sleeping Together</h3>
                    <p>Even though we are far apart, some of my favorite moments with you are when we fall asleep together on call.
I love hearing your soft breathing when you sleep. It makes me feel like you are right here with me. Even with all the distance between us, those quiet moments make everything feel okay.
When we both get sleepy and our voices get slow and soft, it feels so peaceful. I love how we fight to stay awake just to talk a little more, but then we both fall asleep with the call still on.
Waking up and hearing you still there makes my heart so happy. It's like we spent the night together even though we are so far away.
These simple moments mean everything to me. They make the distance feel smaller and remind me that our love is real and strong.
I can't wait for the day when we don't need phone calls to sleep together, but until then, I treasure every single one of these sweet nights with you. </p>

            <h2>My Last Message For You Lovey</h2>
            <div class="decorative-line"></div>
            <p>It is your special day, and my heart feels so sad because I can't be there with you. I wish I could hold you, hug you, and be happy with you. I wish I could see your pretty smile when you wake up and be the first person to say happy birthday to your face.
Being far away from you on your birthday is so hard for me. I want to be there so much. I want to take you out, make you feel special, and spend the whole day making you happy. But even though I can't be there, please know that my love for you is with you every minute of your special day.
I know I don't have any surprise for you. I know I don't have any gifts to give you. You told me to keep my money, and I know why you said that. You always think about me and want me to save my money. This is one more reason why I love you so much, you always care about me even when it's your own special day.
But even without gifts or surprises, I want you to know that my love for you is the biggest gift I can give. My heart, my thoughts, my prayers, and all my love, these are all yours. Every day I wake up loving you more, and on your birthday, that love feels even bigger.
I may not have money to buy you nice things, but I have so many feelings and words for you. I have all these good times we made together, all these happy times we had, even from far away. I have all my dreams about our future together. These may not be things I can put in a box, but they are real and they are all for you.
I wish I could give you everything because that's what you should have. You work so hard every day. You are so strong and take care of yourself. You take care of yourself and still find time to love and care for me. You should have all the best things in life.
Even though we are far apart, we have had so many good times together. Our late night calls, our movie times, our times laughing so much, and our quiet times falling asleep together on call. These times are worth more than any gift I could buy.
I promise you that one day, I will be able to be with you on your birthday. One day, I will be able to give you all the surprises and gifts you should have. One day, being far away won't matter anymore because we will be together.
But for now, all I can give you is my love, my words, and my promise that you mean everything to me. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. You make my life good even when we are far apart.
I hope your birthday is full of happiness, even without me there. I hope you feel loved by your family and friends. I hope you smile a lot and feel special because you really are special.
I will be thinking about you all day tomorrow. I will be sending you all my love through our calls and messages. Even though I can't be there, my heart will be happy with you.
Happy 20th birthday, my beautiful girl. You are amazing, you are loved, and you should have all the happiness in the world. I love you more than you know, and I can't wait for the day when I can be with you on your birthday.
Until then, please feel my love with you always. You are never alone because I am here and you have all of my heart. </p>
